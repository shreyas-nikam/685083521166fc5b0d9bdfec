Okay, here's the content of the document you provided with proper LaTeX formatting for mathematical formulas:

### Bond Pricing Formula
The price of a bond is calculated using the present value formula:
$$
P = \sum_{{t=1}}^{{T}} \frac{{C}}{{(1 + r)^t}} + \frac{{F}}{{(1 + r)^T}}
$$
Where:
- $P$: Price of the bond  
- $C$: Annual coupon payment  
- $F$: Face value of the bond
- $r$: Discount rate (yield to maturity)
- $T$: Number of periods until maturity
